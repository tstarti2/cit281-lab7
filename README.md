# Lab 7: Creating a GitHub Personal Website and Managing a Code Repository

Throughout this lab, I focused on creating my own GitHub Personal Website using GitHub Pages and managing a code repository for my lab work. Here's an overview of what I accomplished:

## Overview

The lab aimed to provide practical experience in setting up a GitHub Personal Website, creating a GitHub repository for lab code, and managing the repository locally using Git.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Creating GitHub Personal Website:** I set up my own GitHub Personal Website using GitHub Pages to showcase my projects, resume, and portfolio.
- **Creating Lab GitHub Code Repository:** I created a GitHub repository dedicated to my lab code, enabling me to manage and version control my work effectively.
- **Cloning GitHub Repository:** I cloned the GitHub repository containing my lab code to my local system, ensuring I have a local copy to work with.
- **Creating Lab JavaScript File and Initializing Node.js Project:** I created a JavaScript file for my lab work and initialized the folder as a Node.js project, allowing me to manage dependencies and scripts efficiently.
- **Updating and Committing Lab JavaScript File:** I updated the lab JavaScript file to include error handling logic and committed my changes to the repository, ensuring proper version control.
- **Pushing Changes to GitHub:** I pushed the committed changes from my local system to my GitHub repository, keeping my codebase synchronized and accessible from anywhere.

## Lab Structure

Throughout the lab, I followed a structured series of steps that allowed me to:
- Set up my own GitHub Personal Website to showcase my projects and portfolio.
- Create a dedicated GitHub repository for managing my lab code, ensuring version control and collaboration.
- Clone the GitHub repository to my local system, allowing me to work on the code locally and synchronize changes with the remote repository.
- Initialize the lab folder as a Node.js project, enabling efficient management of dependencies and scripts.
- Update and commit the lab JavaScript file, practicing error handling and ensuring proper version control.
- Push the committed changes to my GitHub repository, keeping my codebase up-to-date and accessible online.

By completing this lab, I not only created my own GitHub Personal Website but also gained valuable experience in managing a code repository and practicing error handling in JavaScript.
