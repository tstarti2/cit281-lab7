# Lab 7: Creating a GitHub Personal Website and Managing a Code Repository

## Overview

In this lab, you will create your own GitHub Personal Website using GitHub Pages and learn to manage a code repository for your lab work. You will set up a GitHub repository, clone it to your local system, and practice updating and committing changes, including error handling in JavaScript.

## Goals and Outcomes

- **Create your own GitHub Personal Website using GitHub Pages**
- **Create a GitHub repository for your lab code**
- **Clone your GitHub repository to your local system**
- **Create a lab JavaScript file and initialize the folder as a Node.js project**
- **Update and commit the lab JavaScript file to practice error handling**
- **Push your changes to GitHub**

## Lab Structure

### Part 1: Create Your Own GitHub Personal Website Using GitHub Pages

- Set up a GitHub Personal Website using GitHub Pages to showcase your projects, resume, and portfolio.

### Part 2: Create Lab GitHub Code Repository

- Create a GitHub repository specifically for your lab code to manage and version control your work.

### Part 3: Clone Your GitHub Repository to Your Local System

- Clone the GitHub repository you created in Part 2 to your local system using Git.

### Part 4: Create Lab JavaScript File and Initialize Folder as a Node.js Project

- Create a JavaScript file for your lab work and initialize the folder as a Node.js project to manage dependencies and scripts.

### Part 5: Update and Commit Lab JavaScript File to Practice with Error Handling

- Update the lab JavaScript file to include error handling logic and commit your changes to the repository.

### Part 6: Push Your Changes to GitHub

- Push the committed changes from your local system to your GitHub repository to keep your codebase synchronized.

By completing this lab, you will not only have your own GitHub Personal Website but also gain practical experience in managing a code repository, working with Node.js projects, and practicing error handling in JavaScript.
